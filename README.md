Google reCaptcha token harvester

All this does is store tokens in a list, you can work out how to do what you wanna do with the tokens
CBA to make a requirements.txt file so you gonna have to work out which modules you need to install yourself, sorry xox

Instructions:
- you need to edit your hosts file so that you can solve captchas on the domain the captcha is hosted on, for this example we using supreme
- run notepad as administrator --> open file --> c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc
- select view all files --> open file called "hosts"
- somewhere you need to put this: 127.0.0.1 supremenewyork.com
- then click save (not save as)
- put the sitekey for supreme in the code where it is marked (cba to make it inputtable in the actual programming)
- the web address for solving captcha will be "http://WEBSITEYOUCHOSE:5000/solve" you need to put that in the code where it is marked
- save the shit and run it

IF IT DOESN'T WORK, THEN DM ME WHY IT DOESN'T WORK. I DON'T CARE IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO SET IT UP OR USE IT, I WILL NOT HELP YOU xox
